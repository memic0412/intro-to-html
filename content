I’m a first year Graphic Design student at Algonquin College.
I’ve had previous work experience editing photos, web design, working as a team. and doing art commissions
I’m a strong illustrator and it enables me to think outside the box and add the client’s personal touch.
I’ve applied to the internship and id be an excellent fit for the position. 
I’m glade I’ve had the opportunity to introduce myself.
Here’s my contact information. I’d be happy to talk more about my skillsets during an interview!
