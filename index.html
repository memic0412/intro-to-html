        <p>Hi! Welcome to a website about me. I know it’s a bit scary here but I don’t bite I promise! I’m just a small town girl living in a lonely world. I took the midnight train going anywhere.</p>

        <p>I love illustrating and organizing. I think thats why I’m actually enjoying coding. I get to organize all the code and make it look nice and neat. It brings me much satisfaction. One thing I despise is folding clothes. I’m saying this because I can see my laundry basket and it’s mocking me. It’s a simple task; fold and put away. But for some reason id rather live with a layer of clothes on my floor. Help.</p>
